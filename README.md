# wallspeakers

Depth 46mm (as flat as the TV)
Max continuous output 95dB @ >80Hz, 85dB @50Hz (suitable for small room use)
IDD ~ 50mm (minimal lobing at crossover where 1/4 wavelength is ~200mm)
Crossover ~400Hz (avoids BMR distortion below that)
Wide dispersion & low IDD mean even tonality vertically and horizontally for wide or no sweet spot


## construction

The interior depth is set to be exactly the mounting depth of the bass driver less the thickness of the rebate, so the magnet would just touch the back wall if there was no gasket between the driver flange and the rebate.  When mounting, apply a layer of gasket material to the rear of the bass driver as well as to the rebate.
