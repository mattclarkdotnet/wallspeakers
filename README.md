Depth 46mm (as flat as the TV)
Max continuous output 95dB @ >80Hz, 85dB @50Hz (suitable for small room use)
IDD ~ 50mm (minimal lobing at crossover where 1/4 wavelength is ~20cm)
Crossover ~400Hz (avoids BMR distortion below that)
Wide dispersion & low IDD mean even tonality vertically and horizontally for wide or no sweet spot
